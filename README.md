Forecast-rs is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) client library for
the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/). A crate is available
from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/forecast). This project is
tested against Rust stable, beta, and nightly (although Travis is
configured to ignore failures on nightly).

## Disclaimer: everything is alpha

Until this project reaches 1.0.0, everything is subject to change. We
will do our best to conform to [semver 2.0.0](http://semver.org).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This is the first thing I have ever
attempted to write in Rust, so it probably isn't all it could be. If
you encounter a problem using it or see something gross feel free to
submit a pull request or open an issue.
